# MannWhitneyU
Using a MannWhitney Test on gaming data (D0 Playtime) to test # A/B Testing with Mann-Whitney U Test

## Overview
This repository provides a guide for performing A/B testing using gaming data, focusing on player duration times. It demonstrates how to conduct a power test, check for normality, and apply the Mann-Whitney U Test to determine if there are significant differences between the playtimes of two test groups (A & B).

## Objectives
- Conduct a power test
- Perform normality checks
- Apply the Mann-Whitney U Test

## Prerequisites
- Python (3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
Open and run DurationMannWhitney.ipynb notebook.
